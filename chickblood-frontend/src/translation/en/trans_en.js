    "The concept of Index 1 often refers to the initial or primary entry in a series, list, or system that organizes information systematically. This could be the starting point in a database, the first chapter in a book, or the main category in a classification system. The term underscores the importance of a foundational element that helps users understand and navigate the structure of the information presented. In computing, for example, it could denote the first position in an array, where indexing typically starts at zero. In literature, it might refer to the first volume or issue of a series, setting the tone and context for what follows. Similarly, in web development, Index 1 might be the main landing page that guides visitors through a website. This concept is crucial because it establishes a reference point from which all subsequent elements are defined or organized, ensuring coherence and accessibility in information systems.",

  yehoshua: `Issue 1: Xiaozhi

The first interviewee of "Generational Scars" is Xiaozhi. He is a member of Chickblood and a fresh undergraduate graduate this year. This summer, he just went through a hasty graduation ceremony amid the wave of campus protests in the United States, experiencing a sharp decline in social stability and a confusing job market.

His journey as an international student began with the pandemic and ended with protests.

Q: Can you briefly introduce yourself and your current situation?

A: I’m Xiaozhi, 22 years old. I just graduated from Emory University this month, majoring in Business Administration, Psychology, and Linguistics. A full-time consulting offer I received was suddenly revoked over a month before graduation due to my international student status. Now, I’m experiencing life while looking for a job and thinking about what’s next for me.

Q: Can you describe your peer pressure?

A: I think peer pressure mostly comes from an unclear understanding of my identity and future, rather than simply from others. In middle and high school, I was always a unique person. I knew I was special and never compared myself to others on the same track or dimension. So, during middle and high school, I was always in my own rhythm, driven only by my inner motivation, without much peer pressure. But now, in this uncertain era and with my disrupted plans, I seem to have become a bit confused about what I want and my identity. I also feel pressure and anxiety from all sides. I hope I can slowly find my position again, know where I come from and where I want to go, so that I can be on my own track and have no one to compete with.

Q: Do you think the current era you are in brings you more opportunities or more restrictions? Is its impact on you more negative or positive? Do you still have expectations for it?

A: Right now, I’m in a period of forced unemployment. Every day brings new thoughts and ideas, but I also feel quite cynical and unable to really achieve anything. I think traditional plans and opportunities are certainly fewer and more unstable. For example, my career plan in college was always consulting, and I was constantly preparing for and accumulating experience in this field. However, due to the pandemic and the U.S. economy, the entire consulting industry collapsed. Half of the companies in my network haven’t been hiring or are half bankrupt. The full-time offer I finally got was also revoked more than a month before graduation. It’s really frustrating. It feels like, in this era, effort, planning, and even ability cannot guarantee that I can grasp anything. Previously, I felt unsure about what all the hard work and efforts over the years were for. On the other hand, this uncertain era has given me some opportunities to discover unconventional possibilities. I forgot where I heard it, but there’s a saying: "A storm at sea didn’t teach me to swim, but it unexpectedly taught me to surf." I feel that the past accumulation, including the experiences in the current environment, although they are scars, have also made me understand more about who I am, what I am made of, and what this era has brought to me. I will try to explore some directions I hadn’t considered before in this turbulent time, things I wanted to do before but didn’t have the courage to, things that only this era allows me to do. So, I hope this era can give me some courage to let go of previous plans and frameworks and open up some new possibilities for myself. I hope so.

Q: Can I ask if you had any premonition that such things would happen a few years ago? Regarding job hunting, because it seems like we’ve been hearing about the difficulty of finding a job since the pandemic started.

A: A few years ago, I knew that job hunting would be difficult and challenging, but I thought that if I had enough ability and was willing to put in more effort, I would be willing to take on the challenge. But I didn’t expect things to get worse and worse, failing in every sense and in every aspect. I gradually realized that this challenge couldn’t be overcome by ability and willpower alone; it was made up of many uncertainties. For example, my offer was revoked not because of my ability or any factors I could control, but simply because the company didn’t want to sponsor international visas this year. This is something I can’t change—a scar engraved on me that I can only carry with me.

Q: So do you think your nationality has brought limitations to you?

A: It definitely has, but not entirely. I was doing a take-home coding interview at a friend’s house, working for over ten hours. I broke down and told him I couldn’t continue; I was going home to sleep, and I planned to give up. Then I went home and cried, meditated, and prayed. The next day, I felt I couldn’t be discouraged and needed to seize every opportunity and be resilient. So, I spent another whole day and managed to finish it, sent it to the interviewer, passed, and made it to the final round. At that time, I was proud, feeling that I had great perseverance and did something I thought I couldn’t do. But the next week, on the day of the final interview, the company sent an email saying that due to company policy, they were canceling interviews for all international students who might need work visas in the future. Haha, what the hell.

Q: Have you thought about leaving the United States?

A: I never really thought I would stay in the U.S. forever. I’ve actually been quite interested in Japan, and I’ve also considered places like Hong Kong. But at this stage, I still feel like I want to develop in the U.S., apply what I’ve learned here, and experience life here.

Q: You probably didn’t just start looking for a job recently; you’ve been preparing for a while. Is staying in the U.S. your only option now?

A: To be honest, I haven’t really stopped looking for jobs and internships for the past two years—applying for internships in sophomore year and full-time jobs in junior and senior years. My current plan is to, while my visa hasn’t expired, spend this "vacation" (actually, it’s not a vacation—I’m already unemployed, haha) working and experiencing life in different cities in the U.S., feeling and thinking about what I want, and at the same time interviewing and looking for jobs. But I’ve also discussed with my family that if it doesn’t work out, I might take a gap year and apply for graduate school next year. Honestly, with my grades, I can get into a good school for grad school, but I need to think more about what to study, whether to change directions, and what to do during the gap year.

Q: Can I ask how long you’ve been in the U.S.?

A: I came to the U.S. in 2021, attended online classes in China for a year, and by the time I got to campus, it was already my sophomore year.

Q: Were you still in the application stage when the pandemic broke out? Can I ask what your mindset was back then?

A: I think I was between the application stage and receiving an offer? I can’t really remember. At that time, I couldn’t get a U.S. visa, so I was considering whether to take a gap year or attend online classes for a year. If I took a gap year, I felt there would be a lot of uncertainties, so I chose to study online. Back then, I felt the future was very uncertain; I didn’t know where the wind would take me, but I still had confidence to figure it out. Actually, my mindset now is quite similar. Even though things are like this, with nothing but uncertainty in front of me, I’m not in despair. I’m still trying to enjoy the emotions and opportunities brought by randomness and uncertainty.

Q: When you were attending online classes, didn’t you think there might be a possibility that you wouldn’t be able to go to the U.S.? In 2020, the public opinion seemed to lean towards closure. Did you think about what to do if you couldn’t go? At that time, many people around you were probably in the same situation. Do you think everyone did something to alleviate this anxiety, besides online classes or taking a gap year?

A: Yes, at that time, we couldn’t see the end of it and didn’t know when this chaotic state would end. After finally getting the visa and flying away, I didn’t feel like that state had ended; I just escaped. I feel like I’m very adaptable. During the online period in 2020, I did many things I hadn’t thought of before, experienced many things that moved me deeply, like trying to start projects with friends that we thought might make money, haha, and forming a band, writing songs. Even though the things and state back then were quite silly, that period was very energetic, and it was an interesting experience that changed my life. It took me from just liking music to believing I could make music I love, turn inputs into outputs, and truly express my emotions and move others. So, to return to the question, I think even if I still couldn’t go to the U.S. next year, I would still have a meaningful life in this special time.

Q: So, relatively speaking, you had a pretty good time in 2020, right?

A: It was quite good, considering it was during a turbulent period. But it really allowed me to feel and experience things I had never experienced before, and I’m using that time to encourage myself now. It feels like I can’t see the next step, feeling overwhelmed and anxious, but we gon’ be alright.

Q: So, in terms of your academic journey, the pandemic didn’t have that much of an impact on you, relatively speaking?

A: Objectively speaking, it definitely had a big impact, like losing my freshman year, missing out on a year of experience in the U.S. and opportunities to meet people, and affecting the current job environment. But subjectively, I’m very grateful for the experiences and opportunities of that year. It was a magical year for me.

Q: Because you probably had more time to find your passion and explore things you hadn’t touched before. So, after coming to the U.S. in 2021, do you think your state improved compared to 2020, or did it feel like you were being gradually suppressed?

A: I think it’s a different state. Coming to the U.S., I met new people, experienced the culture and education, and went from being confused and aimless in China to being busy with academics and life here.

Q: The recent protests have been very intense. When you first heard that people were starting to protest at school, did you expect it to turn out like this?

A: I did anticipate that the momentum of the protests would grow, but I had no idea about the direction things would take and how the university and the authorities would respond. Initially, it was about understanding the news and what was happening around the world. Then, seeing the reactions and stances of people on campus and around me, gradually feeling the impact of these events on us, far away on the other side of the globe, and developing complex empathy and reflection. Finally, seeing large-scale protests erupt and how they were suppressed by structural violence. Seeing how innocent professors and students around me were suppressed by the violence made me feel like I could see how the people and children in war-torn countries are destroyed by the same ruling forces. Everything seemed so familiar, as if it had happened around me last year, and many years ago around my parents.

Q: I heard that your recent graduation ceremony was also affected by the protests. Can you tell us what the situation was like at that time?

A: Before the graduation ceremony, there were some very fucked up and dramatic events at my school. It started when pro-Palestinian students and faculty set up tents on the campus lawn to protest the school’s funding of the Israeli military. The president claimed that the protesters were outsiders and not students, and used this as a reason to call in state and city police to suppress the protests. When the state and city police arrived, things completely spiraled out of control. Peaceful protesters were violently arrested, professors who came to check on the students were pushed to the ground by the police, passing students were slammed down and handcuffed, and the police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the campus and students. Countless students, professors, and staff were injured and inexplicably arrested. The protests would not end; they would just shift from the issue of Palestine and Israel to a united opposition against the president and higher authorities. The university suspended all classes and moved them online, all related activities on campus except for the graduation ceremony were canceled or moved, and students and professors jointly issued a vote of no confidence against the president. The graduation ceremony was also forced to move off-campus.

Q: Did you or anyone around you participate in the process?

A: I was always an observer, but when I saw familiar professors being pulled by their hair and pushed to the ground just for passing by and checking on the students, when I saw an African-American brother from my church who always came to support us when I performed in the choir being pinned down by the police with a knee on his neck, shouting "we can do better than this," and when I saw my Chinese friends being dragged out of the crowd and slammed into the bushes, then handcuffed, I felt like the war was not just in faraway Israel and Palestine. The war was right beside me.

Q: After the pandemic, the divide between the left and right in the U.S. seems to be getting worse. As a traditionally free country, the freedom of speech environment has taken a sharp turn. After experiencing all this, how do you view "freedom of speech"?

A: I’ve always thought that the U.S. is a particularly divided country, divided by race, gender, class, geography, and many other factors. The so-called traditional free country actually has a huge gap in the lives experienced by different categories of people, and these divisions and segregations are structural cages that are difficult to cross, another form of unfreedom. Especially after seeing the protests and the suppression of the protests, what is freedom of speech? So, I thought I had escaped from one place, but after wandering around, I realized I hadn’t escaped anywhere. When I project this division onto myself, as a male who grew up in an East Asian background and came to the U.S. during my adolescence, I can’t force myself to become anything I’m not, to become a privileged white male in finance, or a lower-class black man on the street, or an LGBTQIA person. But it’s really the East Asian scars on me and my unique experiences that make me who I am, allowing me to reflect on and empathize with all the phenomena happening before my eyes from my own perspective. So, I think we really need to face our scars and embrace the bruises that this era has brought us, to invest ourselves in this era, to feel and struggle. I feel that whether it’s identity, origin, nationality, East Asian educational background, or all the scars left by these experiences, they’ve all become a part of me, things I can’t take away or strip off. The angrier I am about these marks of the times and cultures, the harder it is to let them go. I can’t avoid or reject this part of myself. But with these things, I am who I am. Facing these takes courage, but these scars will also become my tattoos now and in the future, letting me know who I am and letting others see that I am special and profound.

Q: After going through all this, do you still set goals for your future, or in other words, do you still have expectations for the future?

A: I think what this era and my background have brought me is chaos, unease, but also opportunities and reflection. My East Asian identity combined with the scars of the times have given me a unique experience and perspective that allows me to reconcile with my identity. I still feel angry, speak out, and feel disappointed about the world, but this perspective is no longer the flat hatred and disgust I used to have; it’s a more three-dimensional evaluation. As for myself, I’m also facing my past and background, what I am comprised of, and what this era has brought me. Facing these requires courage, but only when I face them can I try to reshape my personality, even though it’s hard and a struggle. But I hope that in this era, we can continue to think, continue to cry, and continue to be angry. I wish we all continue to struggle, my friend.`,
